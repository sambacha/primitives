<h4 id="the-dao-corollary">The DAO Corollary</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>F.K.A. Amdahl‚Äôs Corollary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most efficient way to implement a piece of software is to do it all yourself.</p>

<p>No time is wasted communicating (or arguing); everything that needs to be done is done by the same person, which increases their ability to maintain the software; and the code is by default way more consistent.</p>

<p>Turns out ‚Äúmore efficient (<em>alt</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">effective</code>)‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúfaster (both in performance and time to delivery)‚Äù. When there are more people working on the same problem, we can parallelize more at once.</p>

<p>When we break work up across a team, in order to optimize for the team, we often have to put <em>more</em> work in, individually, to ensure that the work can be efficiently parallelized. This includes explaining concepts, team meetings, code review, pair programming, etc. But by putting that work in, we make the work more parallelized, speeding up and allowing us to make greater gains in the future.</p>

<h2 id="amdahls-law">Amdahl‚Äôs Law</h2>

<p>Amdahl‚Äôs law can be formulated as follows:</p>

\[S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1-p)+\frac{p}{s}}\]

<p>In other words, it predicts the maximum potential speedup (Slatency), given a proportion of the task, p, that will benefit from improved (either more or better) resources, and a parallel speedup factor, s.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, if we can speed up 10% of the task (p=0.1) by a factor of 5 (s=5), we get the following:</p>

\[S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1‚Äì0.1)+\frac{0.1}{5}} \approx 1.09\]

<p>That‚Äôs about a 9% speedup‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAcceptable.</p>

<p>However, if we can speed up 90% of the task (p=0.9) by a factor of 5 (s=5), we get the following:</p>

\[S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1‚Äì0.9)+\frac{0.9}{5}} \approx 3.58\]

<p>That‚Äôs roughly a 250% increase! Big enough that it‚Äôs actually worth creating twice as much work; it still pays off, assuming the value of the work dwarfs the cost of the resources.</p>

<p>$s \rightarrow \infty$, which means $\frac{p}{s} \rightarrow 0$, so we can also drop the $\frac{p}{s}$ term if we can afford potentially infinite resources at no additional cost.<br />
\(S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{1‚Äì0.9}=10\)</p>

<p>In other words, if 90% of the work can be parallelised, we can achieve a theoretical maximum speedup of 10x, or a 900% increase. This is highly unlikely, but gives us a useful upper bound to help us identify where the bottleneck lies.</p>

<h2 id="generalizing-a-pid-to-the-amount-of-work">Generalizing a PID to the amount of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">work</code></h2>

<p>Typically, we start off with a completely serial process. In order to parallelize, we need to do <em>more</em> work. It doesn‚Äôt come for free.</p>

<p>This means that when computing $s$, <strong>the parallel speedup</strong>, we should divide it by the <strong>cost of parallelization</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if the cost is <em>2,</em> that means that making the work <em>parallelisable</em> (without actually increasing the number of resources) makes the parallel portion take twice as long as it used to. (The <strong>serial</strong> portion is unchanged.)</p>

<p>So, if we take the example from earlier, where 90% of the work is parallelisable <em>but</em> it costs twice as much to parallelized, we‚Äôll get the following result:<br />
\(S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1‚Äì0.9)+\frac{0.9}{\frac{5}{2}}} \approx 2.18\)<br />
It‚Äôs still about a $117 \%$ increase in output!<br />
However, if $p=0.1$, then there‚Äôs really very little point in adding more resources.</p>

\[S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1‚Äì0.1)+\frac{0.1}{\frac{5}{2}}} \approx 1.06\]

<p>And if the cost of parallelisation is greater than the potential speedup, bad things happen:<br />
\(S_{\text {latency }}=\frac{1}{(1‚Äì0.1)+\frac{0.1}{\frac{5}{20}}} \approx 0.769\)</p>

<p>Adding 4 more resources slows us down by 23%. Many of us have seen this happen in practice with poor parallelization techniques‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpoor usage of locks, resource contention (especially with regards to I/O), or even redundant work due to mismanaged job distribution.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-it-all-mean">So, What Does It All Mean?</h2>

<p>Amdahl‚Äôs law tells us something very insightful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When the value of your work is much greater than the cost, you should optimize for parallelism, not efficiency</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost of a weekly two-hour team meeting is high (typically in the $1000s each time), but if it means that you can have 7 people on the team, not 3, it‚Äôs often worth it.</p>

<p><a href="[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson's_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_law)">Delivering faster means you can deliver more.</a></p>

<p>Better to have 10 people working on 5 problems and doing a better job than it is to have 10 people working on 10 problems.</p>

<p>The former will lead to fewer conflicts, fewer defects and a much more motivated team. I.e. $p$ and $s$ produce greater returns, faster than the amount of work.</p>

<p>Conversely, if all the knowledge of how the product works is in one person‚Äôs head, $p‚âà0$. While there‚Äôs no impact to efficiency this way, it limits our ability to produce, because one person can only do so much. Adding more people just makes things slower.</p>

<h2 id="proposal"><strong>Proposal</strong></h2>

<p>We introduce a proposal to replace the current regime of quorum based on-chain voting with a new voting regime: Majordomo.</p>

<p>Majordomo is a tribute based governance system. In exchange for delegation of governance voting rights, a <em>tribute</em> is paid to secure this right. There is no opt-out of delegation. The <em>majordomo</em> regulates protocol parameters as well as appoints <em>tribunes</em> through a <em>patronage</em> system. A patronage system is the mechanism of dispensing grants or favors to an address (i.e. a person or persons). Grants can be currency, privilage (e.g. privilaged access to a non-public protocol feature), grants of patent (e.g. extending a franchise right to establish a subsidiary on another chain), etc.</p>

<h2 id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<h2 id="motivation"><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>

<p>This is the problem statement. This is the <strong>why</strong> of the YIP. It should clearly explain <em>why</em> the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain why the change is needed. For instance, if the YIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address why the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This section may also include why certain design choices were made over others, and can include data from previous discussions and forum posts.</p>

<h2 id="specification"><strong>Specification</strong></h2>

<h2 id="axiom-institutions-are-defined-as-stable-patterns-for-regulating-human-behavior">Axiom: Institutions are defined as stable patterns for regulating human behavior.</h2>
<p>In an opt-in organization like a DAO, a constitution serves as a contract for participation‚Äîby participating, one implicitly or explicitly agrees to abide by the organization‚Äôs constitution. By regulating decision-making in an organization, constitutions help us set the rules for how we make rules, modify existing institutions, and even design new institutions. Good constitutions help institutions adapt to new circumstances, new memberships, and even new code (e.g. if any underlying smart contracts are changed).</p>

<h2 id="majordomo">MajorDomo</h2>

<p>Moderation is not an ideology.  It is not an opinion.  It is not a thought.  It is an absence of thought
In other words, the problem with moderation is that the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is not fixed.  It moves.  And since it moves, and people being people, people will try to move it.  This creates an incentive for violence, but we should not look at this as a moral problem, rather as an engineering problem.  Any solution that solves the problem is acceptable.  Any solution that does not solve the problem is not acceptable.[^5]</p>

<p>sing a coinvote in this manner legitimizes any outcome of the community process, and [provides a convenient default](https://pagefair.com/blog/2015/the-tyranny-of-the-default/) for users to converge on. Otherwise phrased, most users will likely accept most outcomes of most coinvotes, so rigging such votes can allow a malicious actor to impose their will on an ecosystem where the majority of honest actors disagree (but follow along anyway, because the vote appears clean).¬† This, along with the direct benefit provided by many consensus rule changes to actors within the system (consider for example the setting of block rewards, or the setting of block size / participation hardware requirements, or the setting of minimum stake, etc.) means that tampering with such votes is often directly financially incentivized.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Populations will accept vote outcomes regardless of how bitterly they disagree with the outcome or how nonsensical it seems‚Ä¶ if they accept the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>deciding whether there is an attack in the presence of a credible threat is a non-trivial social consensus problem vulnerable to false flag attacks to stall progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="glowing-in-the-dark">Glowing in the dark</h3>

<p>Glowing in the dark, flying or sewn into the story with phosphorescent thread. In other words, infiltrators being spotted. Or being so obvious in their work that it may be impossible not to spot them. Infiltrators have been a thing since humanity started forming groups and the notion of counter-intelligence is as old as humanity itself [^4]. This remains a credible threat especially in systems that depend only on capital (i.e token holdings) to determine voting weight.</p>

<p>We can conclude that on-chain token-based voting systems essentially emulate plutocracy. ¬†If they do not directly emulate plutocracy, perhaps through some external system of identity, they can be made to emulate plutocracy through the buying and selling of constraints on user actions.</p>

<p>Schemes like quadratic voting, that have been proposed in a blockchain context, explicitly allow vote buying and attempt to mitigate its impact through an identity-based scheme.¬† Such schemes may have unforeseen properties in a blockchain environment, where identity is a murky concept</p>

<p>It is unlikely that schemes that work well for in-person voting, boardroom meetings, or even coordinator-based protocols will simply port to blockchains without substantial additional work on defining and proving adversarial resilience to both technical and economic attacks in a blockchain-specific context.¬†</p>

<p>It is clear that applying mechanisms that work in traditional information sciences or economics is not sufficient to analyze and represent the equilibria that will actually emerge when a given game is deployed (and matures to importance) in a permissionless blockchain environment.</p>
