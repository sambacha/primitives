<p>This document outlines the design for a marketplace for block construction
(often referred to as block proposer / block builder separation or PBS)
compatible with the upcoming Ethereum merge fork. This trust based solution
closely resembles the
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/overview">current Flashbots auction design 17</a>
with modifications to enable solo staker participation without introducing
changes to Ethereum consensus. This solution aims to bridge the gap to a
<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725">permissionless PBS design 15</a>
which should be strongly considered for the cleanup fork in order to improve
decentralization.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#architecture-3">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This proposed architecture allows validators to outsource the task of block
construction to a network of third party block builders. While the validators
have the ability to include any payload into the chain, we believe network
neutrality and validator revenues are maximized when the validator’s job is
limited to selecting the payload which pays them the most ETH.</p>

<p><a href="https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c9fa06a58cabde886291b28dedb643abd968623c.png" title="image"><img src="https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c9fa06a58cabde886291b28dedb643abd968623c_2_690x216.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The block construction process involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Users and searchers send transactions to block builders through the public
p2p txpool or through direct channels.</li>
  <li>Builders construct execution payloads using these transactions as well as
header parameters provided by validators. Builders may directly set the
validator’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code> address as the coinbase address of the payload,
or the builders may set their own address and include a transaction which
transfers to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code> in the payload.</li>
  <li>Relays receive execution payloads from builders and verify the validity of
the payloads as well as calculate the payload value (amount of ETH paid to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code>).</li>
  <li>Escrows receive the full execution payloads from relays to provide data
availability.</li>
  <li>Validators receive
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a45ee9bf5b1fde766d69e551a6b1a21fe2531734/specs/merge/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader">execution payload headers 8</a>
from relays (execution payloads stripped of the transaction content). The
relay must attach an indication of the payload value to each header. The
validator selects the most valuable header, signs the payload, and returns
it to the relay and escrow to be propagated to the network.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that a single entity may play multiple roles in this system. The roles are
labeled separately as they each lend themselves to some level of specialization.
For redundancy and decentralization, there should be multiple independent
parties competing in each role. In the future, a permissionless PBS design at
the consensus level will remove the need for relays and escrows.</p>

<p>On the validator side, this architecture makes use of an independent middleware
called MEV-Boost which sits between the consensus client and the execution
client. This middleware handles communication with the relays, the profit
switching logic for selecting the most valuable payload, and a fallback
mechanism to a local execution client if relays get disconnected. Using a
middleware instead of direct modification of the consensus clients allows for
maintaining each component independently and provide cross client compatibility
with minimal changes to the
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/5966998897f9526e050fd1438026ce8c94c93fb7/src/engine/specification.md">engine api 2</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0ef8cdd3c5b3f28bc7267aa920aac486338c273.png" title="image"><img src="https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0ef8cdd3c5b3f28bc7267aa920aac486338c273_2_690x420.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>It’s important to note that relays should only be used for payloads during block
construction - relays are not meant to be used for other roles performed by the
execution clients like verifying blocks for attestations. Validators should
always fall back to local payload construction if relays are unavailable.</p>

<p>Since the
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a45ee9bf5b1fde766d69e551a6b1a21fe2531734/specs/merge/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader">execution payload header 8</a>
does not include the transaction content, the risk of validators frontrunning is
eliminated. This design allows solo stakers to participate in MEV thus reducing
the incentive for economic centralization. However, this design also requires
validators to trust the relay to filter invalid payloads, accurately report
payload value, and reveal the transaction content once the header is signed.
Escrows are introduced to improve data availability by duplicating the
transaction content across multiple providers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Validator trust relay for data availability, payload validity, and payload
value accuracy</li>
  <li>Users and searchers trust builders, relays, and escrow for frontrunning
protection</li>
  <li>Minimal changes to consensus clients due to middleware architecture</li>
  <li>Adds additional round trip communication between relay and validator to block
proposal latency</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="client-modifications"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#client-modifications-5">Client Modifications</a></h3>

<p>Flashbots will provide a formal specification similar to the
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/miners/mev-geth-spec/v04">current MEV-Geth specification 2</a>
and will support client implementation teams to add MEV compatibility for the
merge.</p>

<p>The current design requires the following modifications to the consensus client
interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling the validator to include and sign
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/a45ee9bf5b1fde766d69e551a6b1a21fe2531734/specs/merge/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader">execution payload header 8</a>
in beacon blocks instead of full execution payloads</li>
  <li>enabling the validator to sign prefixed messages using the staking keys for
authentication purposes</li>
  <li>enabling the consensus client to route a signed beacon block back to the
middleware instead of attempting to send to the network</li>
  <li>enabling the consensus clients to fall back to a local or remote execution
client if there is a fault in the middleware</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no execution client changes currently required.</p>

<h3 id="malicious-relay"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#malicious-relay-6">Malicious Relay</a></h3>

<p>The most important security mechanism of this design is the ability for all
validators to identify if a relay has turned malicious.</p>

<p>Lets assume the worse case scenario: there is a single relay which is connected
to 100% of the validators. The relay begins proposing invalid blocks and lies
about the value of the payloads such that the validators always selects them.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, a naive MEV-Boost implementation could cause the chain to
halt as validators are no longer proposing valid blocks.</p>

<p>There are three ways for the relay to propose a bad payload:</p>

<ol>
  <li>invalid payload: the payload breaks some consensus rules</li>
  <li>inacurate value: the payload proposed has a different value than claimed
once executed</li>
  <li>missing data: the payload body was never revealed by the relay</li>
</ol>

<p>To mitigate this, it must be possible to either</p>

<p>1: pre validate payload between multiple parties ahead of sending to validators
or</p>

<p>2: for all validators in the network to identify when a relay has proposed a bad
payload and automatically fallback to a safe alternative. Critically, this
security mechanism must be robust in the face of relays who are adversarial
towards each other.</p>

<h3 id="communication-between-mev-boost-and-relays"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#communication-between-mev-boost-and-relays-7">Communication between MEV-Boost and relays</a></h3>

<p>There are multiple alternatives for communication between MEV-Boost and the
relays: push vs pull, direct vs p2p.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to ensure the following requirements are met in order to
select the best implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>it must protect validator privacy by not associating validator key and IP
address</li>
  <li>it must have lowest possible latency</li>
  <li>it must be robust against adversarial relays / validators</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="risk-of-missed-slots"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#risk-of-missed-slots-8"></a>Risk of missed slots</h3>

<p>Missed slots can occur if the block proposer fails to propagate a block in time
for sufficient attestations to be collected. In this case, the block proposer
does not receive the base reward for the block (approx 0.025 eth at 10m eth
staked) nor the transaction and MEV rewards. Since this architecture requires
sending signed headers back to the relays / escrows before propagation to the
attestors, it will be important to understanding what is an acceptable rate of
missed slots and how to minimize it under normal network operating conditions.</p>

<h3 id="header-parameters"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#header-parameters-9"></a>header parameters</h3>

<p>In order to produce valid blocks, builders and relayers must know all of the
attributes of the
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/5966998897f9526e050fd1438026ce8c94c93fb7/src/engine/specification.md#executionpayloadv1">execution payload header 1</a>.
It’s in the interest of validators to provide all the inputs required for block
construction as early as possible. This allows builders to maximize the accuracy
and compute time available for finding an optimal block construction.</p>

<p>All header attributes except from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coinbase</code> can be derived by the builder based
on their observed state of the network. It is up to the middleware to filter
payloads built on incorrect states.</p>

<h3 id="validator-authentication-and-feerecipient-address"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#validator-authentication-and-feerecipient-address-10"></a>validator authentication and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code> address</h3>

<p>The validators needs to communicate to builders and relays the address they wish
to use as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code>. This address is necessary to accurately measure
the value of the proposed payload. Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code> can be any address, the
validator must authenticate themselves when publishing it.</p>

<p>There does not currently exist a way for validators to authenticate and publish
their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeRecipient</code>. The best way to do this would likely be to add a signing
domain which allows validators to safely sign arbitrary messages with their
staking key.</p>

<h3 id="partial-blocks-vs-full-blocks"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#partial-blocks-vs-full-blocks-11"></a>partial blocks vs full blocks</h3>

<p>This specification deprecates the use of “Flashbots Bundles” in the
communication between builders and block proposers in favor of execution
payloads which represent the full ordering and content of a block. While bundles
have provided an efficient auction mechanism for inclusion of transaction at the
top of blocks, they are not expressive enough for all order preference. In
particular, bundle auctions are not well suited for large transactions or
frontrunning protection use cases. Moving to full block proposals means the full
range of preference on ordering can be expressed.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-band-bribes-for-priority-and-mev-smoothing--burning"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#out-of-band-bribes-for-priority-and-mev-smoothing-burning-12"></a>out of band bribes for priority and MEV smoothing / burning</h3>

<p>It is possible some validators will accept out of band bribes to prioritize
certain payloads or attempt to perform time bandit attacks through attestation
bribery. It is not possible to protect against this behavior without consensus
modifications. In theory, consensus could enforce that the block builder which
pays the most to the block proposer in ETH must be included and that the payment
is spread or burned, though the mechanism is out of scope of this proposal
requires further research.</p>

<h3 id="decentralization"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#decentralization-13"></a>decentralization</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the architecture section above, relays are trusted providers of
frontrunning and DoS protection. While the system enables having multiple relays
competing with eachother permissionlessly, it is possible there will only be a
handful of successful relays. We suggest a
<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725">permissionless design 15</a>
be strongly considered by core devs for the cleanup fork in order to eliminate
the need for relays which should improve network decentralization.</p>

<h3 id="client-optimizations"><a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177#client-optimizations-14"></a>client optimizations</h3>

<p>Although not recommended, a validator who is relying exclusively on third party
block builders for block construction may run a stripped down version of an
execution client which removes the transaction pool and the block construction
logic thus reducing the hardware and bandwidth requirement of their client.</p>
